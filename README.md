# Dijkstra Algorithm

This repository contains my Java implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm, developed as part of the homework for the Software Solutions Development course ("Razvoj programskih rje≈°enja").

The Dijkstra algorithm is a fundamental graph algorithm used for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.
